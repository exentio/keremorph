    Pale colors just have 10% less saturation,
    except for black (20% less)

### How to add the scheme in .Xresources

I decided to use a modular approach, inspired by [dkeg](https://github.com/dkeg), this means keremorph is compatible with his schemes.  
To add the scheme to .Xresources, simply paste this into the file, after other settings, and remove the previous colors if present:

    #include <keremorph/keremorph>        ! - Change this if the repo isn't inside ~/keremorph
    ! Colors
    *background:   bg
    *foreground:   fg
    *cursorColor:  cyn

    *color0:      blk
    *color8:      bblk
    *color1:      red
    *color9:      bred
    *color2:      grn
    *color10:     bgrn
    *color3:      ylw
    *color11:     bylw
    *color4:      blu
    *color12:     bblu
    *color5:      mag
    *color13:     bmag
    *color6:      cyn
    *color14:     bcyn
    *color7:      wht
    *color15:     bwht

### How to install GTK and OpenBox themes

That's pretty simple: just copy the folder inside `~/.themes` and apply it with `lxappearance` for GTK and `obconf` for Openbox

### How to install the Chromium/Google Chrome theme

Simply drop it inside the window

### How to install the Sublime Text 3 theme

If you don't have the Boxy theme, or you don't have any mod for it, simply drag `Boxy Theme.sublime-package` inside`~/.config/sublime-text-3/Installed Packages`.  
But if you already have it and you modded it, this gets trickier:  
* Extract the original theme (exactly like you would do with a .zip), and also this modded version  

* Go inside the modded theme's folder, and copy (from the modded's folder into the original's):   
  * `Boxy Keremorph.sublime-theme` in the root.  
  * `schemes/Boxy Keremorph.tmTheme` inside the`schemes` folder.  
  * `assets/specific/keremorph` inside the `assets/specific` folder.  

* Go in the root of the modded's folder and select all (`CTRL + A`), and compress everything in a zip

* Rename the zip `Boxy Theme.sublime-package`

* Apply the theme inside Sublime
